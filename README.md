Project Overview:
In this project, users can register new accounts, log in, create new contacts, delete contacts, update existing contacts, and search for contacts. This comprehensive functionality demonstrates a complete full-stack application.

Frontend Highlights (React.js):
React Components: Developed and managed reusable components.
State & Props: Mastered state management and prop passing for dynamic UIs.
React Hooks: Utilized various hooks such as useState, useEffect, useNavigate, and useLocation for managing component lifecycle and routing.
Routing: Implemented client-side routing with React Router.
Axios: Integrated Axios for making HTTP requests to the backend.
Form Validation: Implemented robust form validation techniques.
Additional Learning:
Conditional rendering.
Handling side effects with useEffect.
Navigating between routes programmatically with useNavigate.
Backend Highlights (Express.js & MongoDB):
Server Setup: Gained hands-on experience in creating a server with Express.js.
Routing & Middleware: Implemented efficient request handling with routers and middleware.
Error Handling: Mastered async handlers and error handling techniques.
Database Integration: Set up MongoDB and created Mongoose schemas.
CRUD Operations: Developed robust APIs for performing CRUD operations on contacts.
Async/Await & Promises: Enhanced my understanding of handling asynchronous operations in Node.js.
User Authentication:
Implemented secure registration and login APIs.
Utilized bcrypt for password hashing and comparison.
JWT Authentication:
Delved into JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for securing user sessions.
JWTs are compact, URL-safe tokens that transfer claims between two parties, offering scalability and security over traditional session-based authentication.
API Testing: Ensured functionality and reliability through rigorous API testing.
Technologies Used:
Backend: Express.js, Node.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, bcrypt, JWT
Frontend: React.js, Axios, React Router, CSS
Database: MongoDB
